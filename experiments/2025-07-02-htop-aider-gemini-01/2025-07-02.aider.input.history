+/ask This is the repository for the htop tool. It builds with autotools. I'd like to port it to build with Bazel. Based on the README, which files would you like to see to find targets to port?

+/ask What are good small targets to port first? Preferably they do not have any outside dependencies.

+/ask Is there a way to include the ncurses package as a depency in the Bazel build? I'd preferably like to use a MODULE.bazel file.

# 2025-07-02 11:38:21.820868
+Can you create a MODULE.bazel file and BUILD.bazel file, pulling in the dependencies necessary to build an "object" target? Here is the snippet for including ncurses: `bazel_dep(name = "ncurses", version = "6.4.20221231.bcr.8")`

+/run bazel build //:object

# 2025-07-02 11:42:56.269963
+That's a great start! However, the build is failing trying to find the ncursesw target. Can you spot the problem and fix?
